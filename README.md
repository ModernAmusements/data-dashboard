# Build a data dashboard with Laravel, Vue and Tailwind: Part I
Let's build a data dashboard together. 
We will take it slow, starting with a few simple views, then incorporate charts, css  and vuex to tie the front end portion together. 
Later we will tie in the back end, database, slack notifications, messaging with twilio, 2FA, TDD tests - the works! 
I am not entirely sure where will this end, but every post will for sure build from the previous one.

## Part I
We cover setting up laravel, some front end bolerplate and generating some mock JSON data that we later render in a vue component.

## Part II
We create a table based layout (with flexbox on tailwind css) for the data we generated in the previous part. We then use Vue to sort the results by column. 

## Part III
Datasets in the real world normally don't come as simple JSON objects. They come from a database storage, and the way to access them is through our backend.
In this post we will focus on creating our data source and seeding it.

## Part IV
Learning to play with collection mehods to create some reports.
